# Microsoft-Engage-22
My submission for the functional prototype round of Microsoft Engage'22 for the track Data Analysis

The inspiration for this project came from a Microsoft article about the company's pledge to be carbon negative by 2030. So, with this challenge, I wanted to assess the environmental impact of the automotive industry on the planet. The application that I created allows the user to check the price of used cars, calculate CO2 emissions, and predict a car's mileage.


The price of the used car is predicted on the basis of horsepower, curb weight, engine size and highway mpg.
The CO2 emissions are predicted on the basis of engine size.
The car mileage is predicted on the basis of number of cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight and the year the model was introduced. 


## Libraries used
1. Pandas - to manipulate the data
2. Numpy - to manipulate the data
3. Matplotlib - for data visualization
4. Seaborn - for data visualization
5. Streamlit - to build UI
